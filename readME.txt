pingPong: An exploration into Javascript Arrays and Looping.  _________________________________________________________________________________________
 Objective: To create a web application that displays a list of numbers based on what a user enters.   ex. if a user enters 18 they will see a list of numbers 0-18.   When this list is created three rules are followed to display certain words.   1.) Numbers divisible by 3 are replaced with "ping"
2.) Numbers divisible by 5 are replaced with "pong"
3.) Numbers divisible by 15 are replaced with "pingpong"  The user then should be able to then enter a new number and see the original list of numbers replaced by a new list ending in the number they have entered. 

_________________________________________________________________________________________

Operation:

When user inputs a number, then this number is run though a function creating a list of numbers up to the one the user entered.   Each number is also checked against a math problem that will dictate if a specific word will show (see above) or if number of the sequence will show up.   Read over business logic to see the Variables and Functions behind how the program runs.
